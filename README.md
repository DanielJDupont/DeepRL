### Why Learn Deep Reinforcement Learning?

There is nothing more interesting to me than seeing these agents making superhuman like decisions in accomplishing their goals.

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms learn directly from interacting with an environment, using neural networks with reinforcement to adapt to complex situations. These algorithms excel in settings such as games and simulations where decision sequences are crucial. The learning process is driven by rewards rather than traditional labeled datasets.

#### These algorithms are autonomous and can figure out how to operate in novel situations that are unpredictable and can do so very efficiently.

#### These algorithms are limited in that the agent will tend to exploit the environment in unintended ways. Training tends to be expensive and time consuming, limiting the simulations that can be done. These algorithms do not generalize well outside of the environment they have been trained in. There is a great deal of human oversight required for the design of the algorithms themselves (hyperparameter tuning, reward function design).

#### Algorithms Covered:

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** Implementation of the DQN algorithm which utilizes deep neural networks to estimate Q-values.
