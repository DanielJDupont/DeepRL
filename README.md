### To develop algorithms that can learn optimal behaviors or strategies from direct interaction with an environment, often in scenarios where explicit training data is unavailable or infeasible to collect. DRL combines neural networks with a reinforcement learning framework, enabling the system to perform in a variety of complex and dynamic environments. This approach is especially powerful in solving problems that require a sequence of decisions to achieve a goal, ranging from playing games and robotics to complex simulations and autonomous systems. The learning process is driven by the reward signals obtained from the environment, rather than pre-defined training datasets, allowing these DRL models to adapt and optimize their behavior based on the outcomes of their actions with no need for traditional labeled training data.

### Algorithms Covered:

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** Implementation of the DQN algorithm which utilizes deep neural networks to estimate Q-values.
