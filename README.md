### Why Learn Deep Reinforcement Learning?

There is nothing more interesting to me than seeing these agents making superhuman like decisions in accomplishing their goals.

> ***I am only passionately curious.***

### Purpose of This Resource?

To improve my personal understanding of Deep Reinforcement Learning.

> ***A person needs new experiences. Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens.***

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms learn directly from interacting with an environment, using neural networks with reinforcement to adapt to complex situations. These algorithms excel in settings such as games and simulations where decision sequences are crucial. The learning process is driven by rewards rather than traditional labeled datasets.

#### These algorithms are autonomous and can figure out how to operate in novel situations that are unpredictable and can do so very efficiently.

#### These algorithms are limited:
- The agent will tend to exploit the environment in unintended ways.
- Training tends to be expensive and time consuming.
- Do not generalize well outside of the environment they have been trained in.
- Human oversight required for the design of the algorithms (neural net design, hyperparameter tuning, reward function design).

#### Algorithms Covered:

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** Implementation of the DQN algorithm which utilizes deep neural networks to estimate Q-values.
