### Why Should You Learn Deep Reinforcement Learning?

There is nothing more interesting than watching these agents make superhuman-like decisions to accomplish their goals.


> ***I am only passionately curious.***

### What Does This Resource Hope to Accomplish?

To improve my personal understanding of Deep Reinforcement Learning.

> ***A person needs new experiences. Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens.***

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms learn directly from interacting with an environment, using neural networks with reinforcement to adapt to complex situations. These algorithms excel in settings such as games and simulations with decisions. The learning process is driven by rewards rather than traditional labeled datasets.

#### These algorithms are autonomous and can operate in novel situations very efficiently.

#### These algorithms are limited:
- The agent tends to exploit the environment in unintended ways.
- Training is expensive and time-consuming.
- They do not generalize well outside of the environment in which they have been trained.
- Human oversight is required for the design of the algorithms (neural network design, hyperparameter tuning, reward function design).

#### Algorithms Covered:

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** Implementation of the DQN algorithm which utilizes deep neural networks to estimate Q-values.
