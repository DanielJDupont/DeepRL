# Deep Reinforcement Learning Tic-Tac-Toe Overview

This algorithm can be divided into three main components:

1. [The Environment](#the-environment)
2. [The Neural Network](#the-neural-network)
3. [The Agent](#the-agent)

## The Environment

The environment setup is described by the following key areas:

#### 1. State Space

The `TicTacToe` class initializes a board as a NumPy array of zeros, representing empty cells. This array, `self.board`, reflects the state space where each element can be:

- `0` for Empty
- `1` for Occupied by player X
- `-1` for Occupied by player O

The `reset()` method reinitializes the board to all zeros, resetting the game state.

#### 2. Action Space

The action space consists of choosing one of the empty cells to place a mark. It is implemented in the `act()` method of the `DQNAgent`, where the agent selects from indices of the board that are still `0`.

#### 3. Rules and State Transitions

The `make_move()` function in the `TicTacToe` class applies the game rules. If a move is valid (`is_valid_move()` returns `True`), it updates the board, changes the current player, and checks the game status. The `check_game_status()` method updates the `game_over` status and identifies the winner, if any. This defines the transition rules by confirming when a move results in a win or a draw.

#### 4. Reward Mechanism

The `reward()` method defines the rewards as follows:

- `1` for a win by 'X'
- `-1` for a win by 'O'
- `0` otherwise

This incentivizes the agent to seek winning strategies.
